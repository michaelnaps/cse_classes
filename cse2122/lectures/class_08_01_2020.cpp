   Variables and Their Declaration
   - variable names are called identifiers
   - variables should have meaningful names that reflect the data being
      stored
   - variables should never have the same name as program keywords
      -examples include: int, double, for, if... and so on
   - declaring a variable includes listing what type of value will go into
      that variable and then the variable name
   - when assigning value to a variable, the variable must be listed first
