// topics include: class types
/*
notes:
   - classes are user-defined data types
   - classes can include:
      - member variables
      - member functions
      - and require descriptions
   - class member functions must be initialized similarly to regular program functions
   - Example: 
      return_type Class_name::function_name (intput);
   - the '::' operator is important as it is the scope resolution
      - tells the class that the function is a member function
      - the Class_name which precedes '::' is a type qualifier
   - to call the member function from the program code use dot operator syntax
   - Example:
      member function: output();
      in code: variable_name.output();
   - the 'private' portion of a class can only be accessed from the class type and member functions inside the class
   - the 'public' portion of a class can be accessed by the main program as well as within the class
