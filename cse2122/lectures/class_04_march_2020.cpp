/*
notes:
   Unnamed Namespace:
      - used to hide helper functions
      - names defined here are local to the compilation unit (file)
      - can only be called within the compilation unit, no qualifier needed
      Example: unnamed namespace format
         namespace
         {
            ... program body
         }
      - this is used when there are functions outside of a class that is the
         program creator does not want used by the implementation program

   - the name of a namespace should be unique to avoid compilation errors

   Inheritance
      - process by which a new class, called the derived class, is created from
         from another class, the base class
      - a derived class automatically has all the member functions of the base class
      - derived class can also have its own member functions and variables
