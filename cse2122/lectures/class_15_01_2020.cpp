notes:
   Programming Style: 
   - Top Down Design
      - also called stepwise refinement
      - break algortihm into subtasks
      - break each subtasks into smaller subtasks
      - eventually the pieces of the program are trivial in size and easy to implement
   - The Black Box Design
      - refers to something that is known how to use but is hidden as to how it works
   
   Function Libraries:
   - these are functions that are included by most basic C++ compilers
   - have basic/complex purposes with the purpose of the programmer not need to do them themselves
      - Example: the cmath library contains the sin and cos function
      - sin and cos are put together by using Taylor series that approximate the value for any given input,
         but since the function exists in cmath, the progammer does not need to worry about it since
         it is guranteed to work
   - the webisite below contains the inputs and outputs for all functions within the C++ standard
      cppreference.com
   
   User-Defined Functions:
      - when working with a void function, a 'return;' statement can be used 
         to exit the function early
