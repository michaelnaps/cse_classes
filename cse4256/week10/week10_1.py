#After you finish and test all of the methods above, you should modify the __init__ methods so that it can be passed a string
#representation of a fraction, such as "14/102". To do this, modify the definition of __init__ as shown below,

#__init__(self, n, d = None):

#In your code, check to see if d is None. If it is, then n holds the string representation. If d is not None,
#then n and d are integers representing the numerator and denominator respectively.

#Finally, modify your code so that the string can represent a number with
#a decimal. For example, "12.354".
